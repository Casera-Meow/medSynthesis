# medSynthesis with TensorFlow (we also provide an improved version in pytorch, you can access it at https://github.com/ginobilinie/medSynthesisV1)

This project is for medical image synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as, synthesize CT from MRI, 7T from 3T, high does PET from low dose PET.

Currently, we have uploaded a 2D GAN in this repository (3D version will also be shared soon). Detailed information can be found in our paper:

# How to run the tensorflow code
The main entrance for the code is main.py

I suppose you have installed:    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tensorflow (>=0.12.1)
     <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simpleITK 
     <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numpy

Steps to run the code:
1. use readMedImg4CaffeCropNie4SingleS.py to extract patches (as limited annotated data can be acquired in medical image fields, we usually use patch as the training unit), and save as hdf5 format.
2. modify the g_model.py if you want to do some changes to the architecture of the generator
3. modify the d_model.py if you want to do some changes to the architecture of the discriminator
4. check the loss function in the loss_functions.py.
5. set up the hyper-parameters in the main.py
6. run the code: python main.py
